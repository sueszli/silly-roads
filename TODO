fix rendering artifact / z-fighting of road and terrain.

don't make wheels sink into road.

start car on road, not beside it.

huge code refactor, more functional style.
- graphics module where you have functions for shapes of objects (ie. render_car which calls render_wheel)
- physics module




better pickup truck models
wiggly and silly looking suspensions and wheels
markings in the middle of the road, trees
space for boost with fire particles
