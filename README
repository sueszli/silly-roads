work in progress

todo:

- start with car on the road
- fix warnings

- huge code refactor, more functional style.
    - graphics module where you have functions for shapes of objects (ie. render_car which calls render_wheel)
    - physics module

- better car model
- air time
- wiggly and silly looking suspensions and wheels
- markings in the middle of the road, trees
- space for boost with fire particles


finally:

- get wasm to work, then deploy to github pages
